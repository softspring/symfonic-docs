## Install SfsBuilder in a new Symfony project

## Create a new symfony project

SfsBuilder is a Symfony project, so first of all we need to create a new Symfony project. 
You can create a new Symfony project using the Symfony CLI or Composer as shown in the official [Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html).

Let's create a new Symfony project using the Symfony CLI:

```bash
symfony new cms-new-project --webapp
```

By default, Symfony 7.0 version will be used, but you can specify the version of Symfony to use:

```bash
symfony new cms-new-project --version="6.4.*" --webapp
```

After creating the project, you can start the Symfony local web server:

```bash
cd cms-new-project
symfony server:start -d
```

## Configure database

SfsBuilder uses Doctrine to manage the database schema. You can use any database supported by Doctrine, but for this example we will use MySQL with Docker.

First of all, you need to modify the composer.yaml file provided by the new Symfony project.

```yaml
# compose.yaml
version: '3'

services:
    ###> doctrine/doctrine-bundle ###
    database:
        image: mysql:${MYSQL_VERSION:-8.3.0}
        environment:
            MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DB:-app}
            # You should definitely change the password in production
            MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD:-!ChangeMe!}
            MYSQL_USER: ${MYSQL_USER:-app}
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:-root}
        healthcheck:
            test: [ "CMD", "mysqladmin" ,"ping", "-h", "localhost" ]
            timeout: 20s
            retries: 10
        volumes:
            - database_data:/var/lib/mysqlql/data:rw
    ###< doctrine/doctrine-bundle ###

volumes:
    ###> doctrine/doctrine-bundle ###
    database_data:
    ###< doctrine/doctrine-bundle ###
```

```yaml
# compose.override.yaml
services:
    ###> doctrine/doctrine-bundle ###
    database:
        ports:
            - "${MYSQL_PORT:-33061}:3306"
    ###< doctrine/doctrine-bundle ###
```

Then you can start the database using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You will need to modify the .env file to configure the database connection:

```
# .env
###> doctrine/doctrine-bundle ###
DATABASE_URL="mysql://app:!ChangeMe!@127.0.0.1:33061/app?serverVersion=8.3.0&charset=utf8mb4"
###< doctrine/doctrine-bundle ###
```

## Install sfs-builder

We will use Symfony Flex to install SfsBuilder in the new Symfony project. 

>[!info]
> By the moment, configure recipes manually and accept dev versions.
> ```bash
> composer config --json extra.symfony.endpoint '["https://api.github.com/repos/softspring/recipes/contents/index.json",  "flex://defaults"]'
> composer config minimum-stability dev
> ```

>[!info]
> Also, you can configure the preferred install type for softspring packages as source:
> ```bash
> composer config 'preferred-install.softspring/*' source
> ```

Install **sfs-builder** package with composer (say Yes or Yes for all packages to install the recipes):

```bash
composer require softspring/sfs-builder:^5.2@dev

 Do you want to execute this recipe?
    [y] Yes
    [n] No
    [a] Yes for all packages, only for the current installation session
    [p] Yes permanently, never ask again for this project
    (defaults to n): a
```

After installing the package, you must run the Doctrine migrations to create the database schema:

```bash
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate -n
```

Now you can see the start page of the SfsBuilder project:

## Configure security

Before you can create your first page, you need to configure security to access the admin area.

You can use any Symfony [security configuration](https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html) or bundle you want, but for this example we will use the Softspring User Bundle.

### Configure Softspring User Bundle

Install the Softspring User Bundle with composer:

```bash
composer require softspring/user-bundle:^5.2@dev
```

We recommend to use the Symfony flex recipes to configure the bundle:

```bash
Do you want to execute this recipe?
    [y] Yes
    [n] No
    [a] Yes for all packages, only for the current installation session
    [p] Yes permanently, never ask again for this project
    (defaults to n): y
```

>[!info]
> Also you can do it manually, see the [installation instructions](../bundles/user-bundle/install.md).

Then a new User entity has been created, and routes to login, register, and reset password have been added.

But still some manual steps are needed to configure the security.

Run the following commands to configure the security and routes:

```bash
mv config/packages/security.yaml.dist config/packages/security.yaml
cat config/routes.yaml.dist >> config/routes.yaml
rm config/routes.yaml.dist 
```

Create the database schema with a new Doctrine migration:

```bash
bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff --namespace="DoctrineMigrations"
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate -n
```

Before entering the admin area, you need to create a user and promote it to the admin role.

```bash
bin/console sfs:user:create username user@example.com 123456
bin/console sfs:user:promote user@example.com
```

Now you can go to admin area and login with the user you just created:
